# House Prediction

## Overview
This is a House Prediction Project done by using Linear Regression algorithm. The trained model is used to predict house price

## Motivation
What could be a perfect way to utilize unfortunate lockdown period? Like most of you, I spend my time in cooking, getting fit, coding and reading some latest research papers on weekends. I start thinking of become Data Science as I notice my interest in it. It sound so amazing that on basis of given data, we are predicting some day - today activities. I start implementing the algorithms in different projects.

## Technical Aspect
Basically current I have limit to myself only till having a trained model.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here https://www.python.org/downloads/. To install all other libraries open command prompt or your env console and type pip install <library_name> like for numpy the installation command will be pip install numpy

## Bug / Feature Request
If you find a bug in the code, kindly open an issue here https://github.com/AnubhaV1212/House-Prediction/issues

## Future Scope
The major scope for future is Deployment. I am currently working on it as soon I finish it, I will include all the required website here If there will be some suggestion or new features or modifing existing one you can open pull request here https://github.com/AnubhaV1212/House-Prediction/pulls

## Data Source
I would like to thanks Kaggle for providing the data and you can find data in this repo i.e. in house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques folder
